# Overview

## What is tfnotify?

tfnotify is a command line tool to parse the [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) outputs and send notifications to the specified target (e.g. Pull Requset, Slack).
It will enhance your CI with Terraform and fasten PR reviews which will encourage more Infrastracture as Code (IaC) in your organization.

This was originally forked from [mercari/tfnotify](https://github.com/mercari/tfnotify) and developing new features and maintainer the product. If you are interested or have any feature requests, please open a GitHub discussion.
